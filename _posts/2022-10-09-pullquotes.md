We developed an explainable machine learning framework to identify location-specific relevance of built environment for urban motorized travel, using a sample of 3.5 million car commutes over one year in Berlin and high-resolution urban form data.

Why? 

Because municipalities are increasingly acknowledging the importance of urban form interventions that can reduce intra-city car travel in achieving more sustainable cities and current academic knowledge for supporting such policies falls short in providing the spatial details required to plan specific interventions. {% include pullquote.html quote="This research provides a starting point for using big data analyses for low-carbon and inclusive urban planning." %} Our results demonstrate that subcenters play a vital role in reducing commuting-related travel distance, giving support to the 15-minute city hypothesis. Observed threshold effects of induced CO2 emissions require low-carbon-policies targeted towards densifying the inner city while releasing peripheral low income communities from car dependence. This research provides a starting point for increasingly rich big data analyses of urban form for creating low-carbon and inclusive urban planning strategies.
