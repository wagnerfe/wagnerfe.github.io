I'm a PhD candidate at the chair **Sustainability Economics of Human Settlements**, advised by **Prof. Dr. Felix Creutzig**. My work focusses on developing sustainable urban transport strategies by using machine learning and causal discovery approaches. In particular, I aim to derive a better understanding for the impact of the built environment on urban mobility. By using predictive modelling, I aim to test different urban development strategies and asses their impact on social, environmental and economic metrics for different time scales.

Prior to my PhD, I was enrolled in the MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development at **University of Cambridge**, where I wrote my master’s thesis on the topic of data governance in the context of Mobility as a Service, supervised by Dr. Timea Nochta. Before, I did a M.Eng and B.Eng at **Technische Hochschule Georg Simon Ohm**, Nuremberg, and Tongji University, Shanghai, with a focus on systems and optimisation theory. In addition, I hold industry experience from working for Trafi, Siemens Mobility Germany and Siemens Ltd. China.
